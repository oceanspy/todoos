To install autocompletion with ZSH and `oh-my-zsh`, you can use the following file: `_todoos`
and put it in ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions

(folder might need to be created manually)

Then, reload `oh-my-zsh` with:
 `source ~/.zshrc`
 `omz reload`

 If you use the `unison` configuration, you can also copy `zsh_todoos` to your home directory and load it in your `.zshrc`

 ```
 cp zsh_todoos ~/.zsh_todoos
 ```

 vi ~/.zshrc
 ```
# Todoos
source ~/.zsh_todoos
```
